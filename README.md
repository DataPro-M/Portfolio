> This approach allows determining whether sections of a document have been plagiarized much easier.                 

To award ratings, this project ran student work through a language model that was trained on original text data.
A higher score indicates that the work is more predicted based on the training data, and therefore it is more likely to be plagiarized. 
* **Python libraries used:** nltk, pandas, scipy
* **Input:** A Corpus of Plagiarised Short Answers
* **Output:** Plagiarism Detector model
